# AntiSlide
Simple Browser Plugin for alerting users when thread sliding is taking place on 4chan.

This was thrown together to help train me in js, and also to experiment with tools to stop gov / media / marketing outfits / trolls from suppressing freedom of speech / shilling with brigades / spurious content and noise. If a thread has only 1 post by the originating id, the plugin inserts a banner in page with the current count of posts to remind users that the thread is likely to be a slide thread.

Currently only supports Chrome. Should work in all versions of Chrome browser.

Instructions: (Chrome)

1. Just download and unzip / or git clone if you're some kind of /gentooman.
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ and check the box for Developer mode in the top right.
3. Click the Load unpacked extension button and select the /src folder to install.

That's it. You should now have comfy flashing red warnings when you have stumbled into a slide thread on 4chan.
